# fiepipe_desktop

By Bradley Friedman, FIE LLC

## DESCRIPTION:

fiepipe_desktop is an extension of fiepipe for the desktop.
In constrast, to say, the mobile device (iOS, 
Android, etc).  Primarily the three main desktop systems; Windows,
Linux and OSX.  As much as possible, Linux and OSX are generalized to
mean UNIX style systems.  As such, we'd hope to be compatible with
something like BSD Unix.

In practice fiepipe was developed for the desktop, and this fiepipe_desktop
project is an attempt at refactoring it into two libraries, such that fiepipe
itself, can run on non-desktop systems. e.g. iOS via Pythonista.

## STATUS:

fiepipe_desktop status is generally linked to fiepipe's status for the time being.


## INSTALL:

fiepipe_desktop's install is the same as fiepipe.  It should be noted that fiepipe_desktop considers fiepipe to 
be a dependency and therefore fiepipe should be installed first.
